# IP denylist for Nginx.
#
# Add one entry per line and reload Nginx to apply.
# Supports individual IPs and CIDR blocks.
#
# Examples:
# deny 203.0.113.45;
# deny 203.0.113.0/24;
#
# NOTE: These rules apply to the client IP as seen by Nginx.
# If you are behind another proxy/CDN, ensure the real IP is being set correctly
# before relying on IP blocks.
